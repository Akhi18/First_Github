    "In this project, we will use the knowledge gained through earlier courses in this certification such as Python for Data Science course, the data visualization with Python course, and finally, the data analysis with Python course along with some additional skills segmentation and clustering. Given a city like the city of Toronto, Canada, we will need to segment it into different neighborhoods using the geographical coordinates of the center of each neighborhood, and then using a combination of location data and machine learning, we will group the neighbourhoods into clusters. For simplicity and accuracy we will be using Foursquare location dataset."
